\chapter{Introduction}

This master thesis aims to develop a trusted continuous integration infrastructure using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to enhance the security and integrity of the software development process. The TPM, a specialized hardware-based security component, will be utilized to establish secure boot, secure storage, and secure measurement of software components, ensuring that only authorized and trusted code is integrated and deployed. The proposed infrastructure will address the challenges of maintaining security in a continuous integration environment and provide a robust solution for secure software development in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape. The goal of this thesis is to design, implement and evaluate the proposed infrastructure, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in securing the software development process.
